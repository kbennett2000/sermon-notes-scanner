     * Primal-dual algorithm is an algorithm for solving special types of variational problems (that is,
     * finding a function to minimize some functional). As the image denoising, in particular, may be seen
     * as the variational problem, primal-dual algorithm then can be used to perform denoising and this is
     * exactly what is implemented.
     *
     * It should be noted, that this implementation was taken from the July 2013 blog entry
     * CITE: MA13 , which also contained (slightly more general) ready-to-use source code on Python.
     * Subsequently, that code was rewritten on C++ with the usage of openCV by Vadim Pisarevsky at the end
     * of July 2013 and finally it was slightly adapted by later authors.
     *
     * Although the thorough discussion and justification of the algorithm involved may be found in
     * CITE: ChambolleEtAl, it might make sense to skim over it here, following CITE: MA13 . To begin
     * with, we consider the 1-byte gray-level images as the functions from the rectangular domain of
     * pixels (it may be seen as set
     * \(\left\{(x,y)\in\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}\mid 1\leq x\leq n,\;1\leq y\leq m\right\}\) for some
     * \(m,\;n\in\mathbb{N}\)) into \(\{0,1,\dots,255\}\). We shall denote the noised images as \(f_i\) and with
     * this view, given some image \(x\) of the same size, we may measure how bad it is by the formula
     *
     * \(\left\|\left\|\nabla x\right\|\right\| + \lambda\sum_i\left\|\left\|x-f_i\right\|\right\|\)
     *
     * \(\|\|\cdot\|\|\) here denotes \(L_2\)-norm and as you see, the first addend states that we want our
     * image to be smooth (ideally, having zero gradient, thus being constant) and the second states that
     * we want our result to be close to the observations we've got. If we treat \(x\) as a function, this is
     * exactly the functional what we seek to minimize and here the Primal-Dual algorithm comes into play.
     *
     * @param observations This array should contain one or more noised versions of the image that is to
     * be restored.
     * @param result Here the denoised image will be stored. There is no need to do pre-allocation of
     * storage space, as it will be automatically allocated, if necessary.
     * @param lambda Corresponds to \(\lambda\) in the formulas above. As it is enlarged, the smooth
     * (blurred) images are treated more favorably than detailed (but maybe more noised) ones. Roughly
     * speaking, as it becomes smaller, the result will be more blur but more sever outliers will be
     * removed.
